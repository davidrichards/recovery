# Recovery

Applying credible information to any problem is hard. Doing it when there is confusion and hostile efforts is critical. I just returned with an essential-work effort across 9 states, I saw first-hand how confused and anxious people have become.  We've been struggling with matching our choices with common sense, preservation, applicable laws, and expert recommendations. This effort develops rules from verifiable notes and applies them to data so that people can more-easily create a more-complete idea how this information applies locally.

My approach uses rule-based models (relatively simple), but with:

* sources for every conclusion
* our understanding of those sources
* rules and processing generated by our understanding
* those that researched, reviewed, and approved everything

Because of this traceablity and through principles of good services, this should be a tractable approach to providing credible information in a confusing and sometimes hostile environment.
